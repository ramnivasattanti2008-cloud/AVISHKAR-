#             The WHOLE file, 299 lines, byte for byte. It imports no Home Assistant module and
#             needs none of SEM's device classes, so nothing was adapted. This comment block is
#             the only addition; everything below it is upstream's, starting with its own docstring.
#
# Why this file is here. `sem_surplus.solar_bounded_reclaim` bounds a reclaim but does not produce
# one, so vendoring that alone left half a mechanism. This is the other half: how much of the power
# now charging the home battery a higher-priority load may take instead, plus the sustained-reading
# helpers that decide when a meter or a charger should be believed.
#
# The idea is "loads charge before the battery": above the reserve floor, power that would otherwise
# fill the pack joins the surplus pool so the priority walk spends it first and the battery is the
# sink at the bottom. Below the floor the pack fills first, which is what protects the evening.
#
# The two refinements that are hard to rediscover, and the reason this is vendored and not written:
#
#   * only the SOLAR-funded share of the charge is reclaimable. An inverter filling its pack from the
#     grid on its own time-of-use window shows the same positive charge power with nothing behind it
#     but the meter, and a "solar only" load took it -- upstream's pool pump ran 4.3 hours from 01:29
#     (#938, alexmc1510, 09.09.2026);
#   * a reading has to LAST before it is acted on. `sustained_import` takes the mean of the last two
#     minutes and `sustained_car_draw` the highest car draw over the same window, because a charger's
#     power sensor can trail the meter by a minute at a start, a ramp or a stop.
#
# Upstream's own tests for this file run against this copy, in
# tests/avishkar_ems/test_vendored_sem_surplus.py.

"""#576 — reclaimable battery-charge power.

The single quantity behind "loads charge before the battery": above the
reserve zone, power that would otherwise charge the home battery is added
to the surplus pool, so the surplus loads (walked by their own priority)
consume it first and the battery is the sink at the bottom. Pure function
so it is fully unit-testable without a coordinator.

There is **no opt-in toggle** — this is simply how device priority relates
to battery charging. The reserve floor (``battery_priority_soc``) protects
the evening: below it, the battery still fills first.

    (#938) Only the solar-funded share of that charge is surplus. The reclaim
    was built on the picture "the sun would charge the battery, so a load may
    have those watts instead" — and read the WHOLE charge power as if it were
    that. An inverter filling its pack from the GRID (a TOU window set in the
    inverter, an external EMS — anything SEM did not command) presents the
    same positive charge power with nothing behind it but the meter. Live: a
    Solar-only pool pump switched on at 01:29 and ran 4.3 h against a night
    grid charge that ``solar_bounded_surplus`` had already pinned to 0 W on
    the export side (alexmc1510, 09.09.2026). Import while
    the pack charges means the grid, not the sun, is filling it — so the
    import comes off the top. Before any load commits, this is exactly the
    solar-funded share (``solar − house − ev``); once a load runs on it the
    pool is unchanged whether the pack yields or not, which is the #899
    commit-then-measure question and stays with the EV redirect.

    been read once this lifetime, and with no evidence that the sun is
    funding the charge nothing is reclaimed (fail-closed, the #925 rule).
    ``solar_bounded_reclaim`` in the surplus controller is the independent
    second ceiling (``surplus + reclaim ≤ solar``).
